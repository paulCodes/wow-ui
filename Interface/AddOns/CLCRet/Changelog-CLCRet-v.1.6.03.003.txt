cremor's updates for retribution:

* Fixed *_exec action for 2T17. Assuming the 2T17 buff will trigger IsUsableSpell(howId) (and I hope it will, otherwise we'll need more changes) this buff shouldn't trigger the *_exec actions. Therefore they now use target health instead of IsUsableSpell(howId).
* Added support for 4T17 detection. Now exo_bc will be shown in the 2nd icon after how. This is done by scanning the equipped items in the PLAYER_EQUIPMENT_CHANGED event.
* Added the GLYPH_REMOVED event because I noticed it was missing.
